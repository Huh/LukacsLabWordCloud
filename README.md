# LukacsLabWordCloud

The Lukacs Lab is conducts quantitative wildlife research and is based at the University of Montana.  We have taken to making pretty graphics for our door and since we are all R users we decided to build a word cloud using R.  The code in this repository is our first word and will be displayed on our door.

Each lab member should create a list of at least 10 words that describe their research in the lab, then save it as a .RData file in the data folder. An example data frame looks like: 

Name | Word 
--- | ---
Anna | space-to-event
Anna | population 
Anna | modeling
