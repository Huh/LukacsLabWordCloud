# LukacsLabWordCloud

The Lukacs Lab is conducts quantitative wildlife research and is based at the University of Montana.  We have taken to making pretty graphics for our door and since we are all R users we decided to build a word cloud using R.  The code in this repository is our first word and will be displayed on our door.
